# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

### Description

How i'm thinking to solve this problem:

1. Create a form for events/appointments
2. Create a list to display events saved in the localstoarge
   a) Instead of localstoarge if we don't use any rest api we can use a state management like redux, in this way we
   don't need to reload the page to see the events when we create one
   b) This list should have edit and delete buttons

3. Display the list of events in the Show Events page using react-big-calendar
4. Create a form for doctors/attendes in order to use a dropdown with a list of doctors/attendes when we create a event

I've used material ui/react-big-calendar (no time to use it)
